# Stock Price Prediction Project README



## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict stock prices and developing an interactive dashboard for comprehensive stock analysis. The project is divided into several key segments:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding and exploring the provided datasets to gain insights into stock data characteristics, patterns, and trends.
- Identifying key features and relationships that might influence stock price movements.

### 2. Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Network
- Predicting stock prices employing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.
- Utilizes a dataset specific to the stocks being predicted.

### 3. Dashboard Development using Plotly Dash for Stock Analysis
- Creating an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze stock data.
- Incorporates a multi-stock dataset containing information on various stocks.

## Project Components

- **Datasets**
  - Dataset relevant to the stocks under prediction.
  - Supplementary dataset for multi-stock analysis.

## Implementation Steps

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform initial data exploration using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Visualize trends, correlations, and distributions within the stock datasets.

### Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
- Python code snippets leveraging Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, and Scikit-learn libraries.
- Preprocessing data, building, training, and saving the LSTM model, and visualizing predictions.

### Dashboard Development with Plotly Dash
- Constructing an interactive dashboard using Python's Dash framework.
- Integrating visualizations for stock analysis with real
